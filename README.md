this is the Solution I have came up with for the assessment

Strengths in Solution:
- UI building, especially the Custom cell
- Network Layer

Weakness in Solution:
- time to complete. I wasn't expecting the assessment to take this long, the main problem was the second API
- API filtering. I made many attempts to handle the JSON responses of schools that have no SAT scores. I ended up making statics strings for the nill values
